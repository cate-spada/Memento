# Memento

This repository hosts the implementation of a distributed system designed for creating and managing a shared agenda among a group of individuals, such as colleagues needing to coordinate deadlines and appointments. 

The system provides users with the ability to:
- Create and share events on the calendar.
- Attach notes or files to events.
- Accept invitations to participate in events.
- Delete events they have created, triggering notifications to other users.
  
The project includes a web-based front-end, developed in Angular, providing users with a user-friendly interface for interacting with the shared agenda.

The system is implemented using Amazon AWS services for computing, storage, and virtualization.
